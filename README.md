# Feeding the Devil

Description
- "Feeding the Devil" focuses on feeding a dog named Pochita and depending on what
  you feed him he will respond accordingly. This is my first full on Solo Project
  where everything was made by me completely. From the art to the
  sounds, I was able to implement different aspects of my creativity into this project.
